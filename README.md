# Batch-File-Troll-Template
This is for people who are getting started and are new with coding and/or learning how to make Batch files. Feel free to use this to your content.

## What Happened in the Code / What do certain lines do?
`@ECHO OFF` This just makes the Command Prompt show as a window instead of running in the background

`TITLE GET JEBAITED NERD` This is the title of the Command Prompt window

`ECHO <Message>` This displays a message in Command Prompt

`set url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"` Sets a url function for a [RickRoll Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

`start microsoft-edge:%url%` Launches Microsoft Edge with the provided url function

`PAUSE` Forces the window to stay open until you press a key, instead of closing as soon as the code runs it's functions

`:: <Message>` This is just a comment, something that doesn't run anything in the code, possibly for notes, you can only see this while editing the code


Have fun learning the rest that you would need to do while making Batch files!
